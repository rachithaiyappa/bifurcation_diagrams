# bifurcation_diagrams
This is an extension of Jitesh et al work on mesoscopic models of collective behaviour.

[Here is the link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05368.pdf)

The idea was to look at noise induced bifurcation diagrams of the models descrribed in the aforementioned paper.

The two main models are :
1. Pairwise interaction model 
2. Higher order interaction model

More details regarding the model can be found in the paper.

Interactive plots have been created with jupyter notebook inorder to show the user the influence which parameters of the system have in determining the steady state of the system
